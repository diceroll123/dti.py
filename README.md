# dti.py
An async API wrapper for Dress To Impress written in Python.

Some notes:
- *For the time being*, there are no front-facing docs for this beyond docstrings in the code itself
- Breaking changes are very likely to happen until this lib + DTI2020 are considered stable
- Until the lib is stable, I may push code with little-to-no decent commit messages 🤪

# Installing
**Python 3.7 or higher is suggested**

This project will likely never be put on pypi, so you'll have to install the development version, from this repo.

```sh
python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/diceroll123/dti.py
```

*Alternatively,*

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/diceroll123/dti.py
$ cd dti.py
$ python -m pip install -U .
```

# Examples
*Since there is no obvious "first thing to do" with this library, simply refer to the examples folder for all examples.*
